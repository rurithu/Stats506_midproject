### Report
Click [here](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/ZhihaoXu/Stats506_midproject/blob/main/writeup.html) to see our latest version of write-up

### Topic
Creating propensity score weights and using inverse propensity weights and/or matching for analysis.

#### Concept
1. Propensity score estimation
2. Propensity score matching
3. Inverse propensity weights

#### Research Question
Whether or not adult patients with diabetes have higher risk for heart attack (myocardial infarction) in the United States?

### TODO LIST
- Python
  + Write detail instruction about the core package used
  + Add balance checking before and after matching
- R
  + Detailed tutorial on core packages 
  + T-test
- SAS
  + Create Graphs to compare data 
  + Add balance check
- STATA
  + Create Confidence Intervals for all of the variables in order to know which to choose in our final model
  + Create a standardized balance table and compare the means 
  + Create graphics 
  + For matching, I will create a line graph and juxtapose the untreated vs. treated 
  + For weighting, I will create two density graphs to compare 
  + I will also a linear regression estimation using the teffects ra function
  + Create Graphs comparing pre-match data and match data 
  + Create graphs comparing pre-weighted data to weighted data 
  + standardized tables for both matched and weighted data to compare to initial data set

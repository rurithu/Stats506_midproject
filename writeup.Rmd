## About

### Research Question
A propensity score is the **conditional probability** that a subject receives
"treatment" given the subjectâ€™s observed covariates. When estimating treatment
effects on a binary outcome, it may happen that the treatments are not randomly
assigned to subjects, which is somewhat often the case in observational
studies. Propensity scoring aims to mimic what happens in randomized controlled
trials by balancing observed covariates between subjects in control and
treatment groups.

The purpose of this tutorial is to introduce how to perform propensity score
analyses. In the following sections we will use the data from the National
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
([NHANES](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/index.htm)). We will use the
propensity score as a tool to figure out the following question:

> Whether or not adult patients with diabetes have higher risk for heart attack (myocardial infarction) in the United States?

Hereâ€™s are the main reasons why we choose this method: 

- This dataset is based on observational data but not experimental and 
thus has selection bias.
- There are many confounding variables, such as age, body mass index (BMI),
year of smoking etc. Also, among other variables, like race or income that 
seem to be irrelevant with this question may also have the potential to impact
our outcome and be confounding variables.

## Tutorial Procedure
#### 1. Create Propensity Score
Just the same as doing a randomized controlled trial, we would want our
treatment and control groups to have variables which have similar point
estimates, such as roughly same mean age or mean BMI. Then Logistic Regression
can be introduced to develop propensity scores, since it can represent the
conditional probability that a patient receives the treatment given the
observed covariates.

$$
p(x) = P(T=1|X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_n)
$$
Therefore, we create a logistic model in which we take treatment, namely
diabetes, as our response, and the other variables (except heart_attack and
weights) as our predictors. Then each observation is assigned with a
probability on which we can perform our matching.  

Note that we are not overly focusing on how well our model predicts whether a
patient receives treatment or not. Here, what is more important is that we
include all predictor variables in the model that are correlated or may be
correlated with our outcome. So based on this we can do our best to eliminate
the bias caused by the pre-treatment characteristics of the dataset.

#### 2. Propensity Score Matching

Here we use the propensity score to create 1-1 mapping between treatment and
control groups. We also identify a caliper, which is a defined width based on
a proportion of the standard deviation of the logit of the propensity score. 
Each observation from the treatment group is matched to the nearest 
observation in the control group that has not yet been matched by propensity 
score. The observations must have propensity scores that are within the 
caliper distance of each other. Here we choose 0.2*standard deviation as 
caliper distance.

#### 3. Compare the Matched Control Group with the Original Control Group

Here we first compute the frequency table and the proportion of having heart 
attack for both the matched control group and the original control group. We 
can further use T-test to figure out whether the difference between the 
control group and the treatment group is statistically significant or not.

#### 4. Create Inverse Propensity Weight

In propensity score matching, a large proportion of observations are not 
counted in the final frequency table because they are not matched. 
And this is due to a difference in the number of treatment groups and control 
groups. Using inverse propensity score weight, we can keep all this 
information by assigning different weight to different observations. Here we 
use to Average Treatment Effect (ATE) as our propensity weight, which is 
generally the quantity estimated when running a randomized study, and can be 
computed by

$$
w_{ATE}(x) = \frac{T}{p(x)} + \frac{1 - T}{1 - p(x)}
$$


## Software Tutorial {.tabset .tabset-pills .tabset-fade}
### Python 
```{r setup_py, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(message = FALSE, echo = TRUE)
library(reticulate)
library(tidyverse)
use_python("/opt/anaconda3/bin/python")
```


In this `python` tutorial, we mainly use the following package. `numpy` and 
`pandas` are used to read and process the data, `sklearn.linear_model` is used
to fit the logistic regression model, `statsmodels.stats.weightstats` is used 
to construct the t-test with sample weight. All the algorithms related to 
propensity score weighting in this tutorial are implemented in `python`, but 
the tables and figures are visualized by `R(tidyverse)` using the output 
extracted from `python`. All the `python` variables are stored in a `R` list 
called `py` automatically and can be extracted by `$`.


```{python load_package, engine.path="/opt/anaconda3/bin/python"}
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from statsmodels.stats.weightstats import ttest_ind
```


```{python read_data, engine.path="/opt/anaconda3/bin/python"}
nhanes = pd.read_csv('./data/nhanes.csv')
nhanes_X = nhanes.drop(columns=['id', 'heart_attack','diabete','weight'])
nhanes_diab = nhanes['diabete']
weight = nhanes['weight']
```


#### Estimate the Propensity Score by Fitting a Logistic Regression Model
```{python lg, engine.path="/opt/anaconda3/bin/python"}
lg = LogisticRegression(random_state=0, max_iter = 1000)
lg.fit(nhanes_X, nhanes_diab, sample_weight = weight)
prop_score = lg.predict_proba(nhanes_X)[:,1]
```

```{r py_psplot, fig.cap=cap,fig.height=4,fig.width=8,echo=FALSE}
cap = "**Figure 1:** Propensity score distribution by Treated/Control Groups"
ps = data.frame(
  p_score = py$prop_score,
  diabete = ifelse(py$nhanes_diab, "Diabetes", "No Diabetes")
)

ps %>%
  ggplot( aes(x = p_score) ) + 
  geom_histogram( aes(color = diabete, fill = diabete),
                      position = "identity", bins = 30, alpha = 0.3) +
  xlab("Propensity Score") + 
  ylab("Frequency") +
  theme_bw()
```

Through **Figure 1**, we can see that, compared with diabetes patient, the 
non-diabetes patients usually have lower propensity scores. If we compare the 
`heart attack` rate directly, it is very likely to lead to a misleading 
result. Hence, we need to implement the Propensity Score Weighting/Matching 
to reduce the impact of covariates.

#### Propensity Score Matching by Nearest Neighbor
```{python psmatch}
dia_idx = np.where(nhanes['diabete'].values==1)
non_dia_idx = np.where(nhanes['diabete'].values==0)
prop_score_logit = np.log(prop_score / (1 - prop_score))
std = np.std(prop_score_logit[dia_idx])
result = [0]*len(prop_score_logit[dia_idx])
for i in range(len(prop_score_logit[dia_idx])):
    dif = prop_score_logit[dia_idx][i] - prop_score_logit[non_dia_idx]
    dif[np.array(result)[np.array(result)!=0]] = 100
    min_val = min(abs(dif))
    if min_val > 0.2*std:
        result[i] = 0
    else:
        result[i] = np.where(abs(dif)==min_val)[0][0]
        
result = np.array(result)
dia_idx_matched = dia_idx[0][result!=0]
result = result[result!=0]
matched_idx = non_dia_idx[0][result]
heart_matched = nhanes['heart_attack'].values[matched_idx]
heart_non_dia = nhanes['heart_attack'].values[non_dia_idx]
heart_dia_matched = nhanes['heart_attack'].values[dia_idx_matched]
```


```{python ttestpy}
ttest_match = ttest_ind(heart_dia_matched, heart_matched, usevar='unequal', 
                        weights=(weight[dia_idx_matched], weight[matched_idx]))
```

#### Estimate the Propensity Weights

ps_weight = nhanes['diabete']/prop_score + (1 - nhanes['diabete'])/(1 - prop_score)
```

                       weights=nhanes['weight'][matched_idx]), 
            np.average(nhanes_X[i][dia_idx_matched],
                       weights=nhanes['weight'][dia_idx_matched])]
    re_sd = [np.sqrt(np.average((nhanes_X[i][matched_idx]-re_m[0])**2, 
                                weights=nhanes['weight'][matched_idx])),

```


#### Result Interpretation
Through **Table 1**, **Table 2** and **Table 4**, we can see that before 
matching/weighting, the rate of `heart attack` in diabetes patients is around 
7 times larger than the non-diabetes patients. After matching/weighting, this 
rate decreases to only 2-3 times larger, which indicates that our 
matching/weighting significantly reduce the effect of the covariates. 
**Table 5** also shows similar result. Before matching, the `heart_attack` 
rate in `relative_heart_attack`, `age`, `bmi`, `blood_press`, `blood_press2`, 
`hyper_med`, `hbq_med`, `year_smoke` and `year_hyper` are significantly 
different between diabetes patients and non-diabetes patients. However, after 
matching, the rates in all corresponding covariates look similar, which is 
another evidence of the effect of propensity score matching. **Table 3** shows
the t test result, which indicates that after matching, the `heart attack` 
rate in diabetes patients is still higher than the non-diabetes patients.

### R
#### Libraries:    
```{r libraries, message = FALSE}
# libraries: ------------------------------------------------------------------
library(MatchIt)
library(survey)
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
library(tableone)
```
  * `MatchIt`: The package has `matchit` function, 
  which is used to perform propensity score matching.  
  * `survey`: `svydesign` and `svyglm` functions in this package are 
  used to perform logistic regression with sample weights.  
  * `tidyverse`: The package used for data I/O and preparation.  
  * `ggplot2`: The package used for data visualization.  
  * `tableone`: The package used for balance generating balance 
  checking tables.
       
#### Step 1 - Pre-evaluating before matching   
```{r data, message = FALSE}
# data: ----------------------------------------------------------------------
nhanes = read_delim("./data/nhanes.csv", delim = ",")
nhanes = nhanes %>%
  mutate(
    diabete = as.factor(diabete),
    heart_attack = as.factor(heart_attack),
    gender = ifelse(gender == 2, 1, 0),
  )
```
  
```{r check balance 1}
var = c("relative_heart_attack", "gender", "age", "race", "edu", "annual_income",
        "bmi", "smoke_life", "phy_vigorous", "phy_moderate", "blood_press",
        "blood_press2", "hyper_med", "high_chol", "meadial_access", "cover_hc",
        "health_diet", "year_smoke", "year_hyper")
match_tab1 = CreateTableOne(vars=var, strata="diabete", data=nhanes, test=FALSE)
print(match_tab1, smd = TRUE)  
```
  * We use the pre-matched data to do balance check between treatment and 
  control groups. We computed the average standardized differences (SMD) for 
  each covariates. From the table, we can find that, for most of the 
  covariates, there are pretty large differences between treatment and
  control groups.   
     
#### Step 2 - Propensity score estimation     
```{r p_score, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
## Logistic regression for treatment ~ pretreatment:
design_ps = svydesign( ids = ~1, weights = ~weight, data = nhanes )
ps_mod = svyglm(diabete ~ relative_heart_attack + gender + age + race + edu 
                + annual_income + bmi + smoke_life + phy_vigorous + phy_moderate
                + blood_press + blood_press2 + hyper_med + hbq_med + high_chol 
                + meadial_access + cover_hc + health_diet + year_smoke + year_hyper,
                family = binomial(),
                design = design_ps)
## Get the propensity score:
p_score = predict(ps_mod, type = "response")
```
  * We estimate the propensity score by running a logistic model, where the 
  outcome variable `diabete` is a binary variable indicating treatment status 
  and all the other covariates are used as predictors. In order to include 
  sample weights in the model, we also used `svydesign` and `svyglm` 
  functions in the `survey` package.   
  * With the logistic model, we can calculate the propensity score, 
  which is simply the predicted probability of being treated.   
  * The distribution of the generated propensity scores in treatment/control 
  groups are shown below. From figure 1, we can find that there are some 
  overlaps between the two groups, which guarantees the propensity score 
  matching sample.

                    caliper = .2,
                    ratio = 1,
                    data = nhanes_ps,
                    replace = FALSE)
ps_match = match.data(match_mod)
```
  * We can use propensity score matching to generate a sub-sample, which 
  minimizes the covariates' difference between treatment group and control 
  group. The `matchit` function in `MatchIt` package can estimate the 
  propensity score internally and match observations based on different 
  methods. The method we chose in this tutorial example is nearest 
  neighborhood.  
    
#### Step 4 - Balance Checking after matching  
```{r check balance 2}
var = c("relative_heart_attack", "gender", "age", "race", "edu", "annual_income",
        "bmi", "smoke_life", "phy_vigorous", "phy_moderate", "blood_press",
        "blood_press2", "hyper_med", "high_chol", "meadial_access", "cover_hc",
        "health_diet", "year_smoke", "year_hyper")
match_tab = CreateTableOne(vars=var, strata="diabete", data=ps_match, test=FALSE)
print(match_tab, smd = TRUE)  
```
  * By using the same method of the pre-evaluation mentioned in Step 1, 
  we can do the balance checking again using the matched sample. 
  From the table, it's obvious to observe significant decreases in SMD 
  of all covariates. The difference between treatment group and control 
  group became insignificant with the matched sample.  
    
#### Step 5 - Comparison between pre_match data and matched data

##### Proportion of Heat Attack with Matched Group

  ) %>%
  transmute(
    `Heart Attack` = ifelse(heart_attack == 1, "YES", "NO"),
    Diabetes = ifelse(diabete == 1, "Diabetes", "NoDiabetes"),
    prop = sprintf('%10.0f (%4.2f%%)', n, prop)

##### t-test
```{r ttest}
heart_attack_d = ps_match %>%
  filter(diabete == 1)

heart_attack_nd = ps_match %>%
  filter(diabete == 0) 

print(t.test(as.numeric(heart_attack_d$heart_attack), as.numeric(heart_attack_nd$heart_attack)))
```
  * With the t-test result, we reject the hypothesis that the mean value 
  of heart attack in two groups are equal. So with the matched data, the 
  heart attack rate in diabete group is still higher than the 
  non-diabete group.  
  
#### Step 6 - Inverse propensity score weighting    
  * We also can generate the inverse propensity score weight to reduce 
  the bias between treatment and control groups.

### SAS

#### README

In this `SAS` tutorial, we mainly use the following procedure. `proc import` 
and `macros` `csvexport`(Contributed by Dr.Henderson) are used to read and 
export the data. `proc logistic` is used to fit the logistic regression model 
and predicts propensity score, and `gmatch`(Contributed by The Division of 
Biostatistics at the Mayo Clinic) perfroms the greedy matching.   
     
Then we use `proc gchart` to reveal the structure of the data, thereafter 
using `proc means` along with `proc ttest` to compute means and construct the 
t-test with sample weight.     
        
This work is done primarily in `SAS`, with the exception that the write up 
and figures or tables  for visualization are produced in R.

#### 1. Distribution of Propensity Score

```{r ps_sas, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(ps_distribution)
```

#### Explanation

From the figure above, we see that there is a huge difference in the 
distribution of propensity score of two groups. If we compare the heart attack
rate directly, a misleading result may occur. Therefore, we need to implement 
the Propensity Score Matching/Weighting to achieve balance or comparability 
of treatment groups in terms of their measured pretreatment covariates, and 
thereby controls for confounding bias in estimating treatment effects.

#### 2. Comparison Table Between Prematch Data And Macthed Data 
#### {.tabset .tabset-fade .tabset-pills}

```{r tables_sas, message=FALSE,echo=FALSE}

}
```

##### Before Match

```{r table_1_sas,echo=FALSE}
cap = paste0(
"**Table 1.** Proportion of Heat Attack with Pre-matched Group"
)
tab(prematch,
    cap = cap
    )
```

##### After Match

```{r table_2_sas,echo=FALSE}
cap = paste0(
"**Table 2.** Proportion of Heat Attack with Matched Group"

tab(matched,
    cap = cap
    )
```

##### Using Iverse Propensity Weight

```{r table_3_sas,echo=FALSE}
cap = paste0(
"**Table 3.** Proportion of Heat Attack with Inverse Propensity Weight"
)
tab(inverseweight,
    cap = cap
    )
```


#### Explanation

These tables show how `Propensity Score Matching/Weighting` eliminate or 
reduce the effect of pre-treatment covariates on estimating treatment effect.     
We can see that before matching/weighting, the rate of heart attack in 
diabetes patients is around 7 times larger than the non-diabetes patients. 
After matching/weighting, this rate decreases to only 2-3 times larger. This 
tells us the diabetes does have an effect on heart attack, but not that much.

#### 3. Comparison Graph Between Prematch Data And Macthed Data 
#### {.tabset .tabset-fade .tabset-pills}

##### Age

##### Blood Press 2

```{r bloodpress2_sas,echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(press2_pre)
knitr::include_graphics(press2_after)
```

#### Explanation

These graphs give us a direct and clear sense of how 
`Propensity Score Matching/Weighting` balance the pre-treatment covariates.
Here I select `age`, `year of smoke`, `year of hyper`,
`blood pressure` to illustrate this fact. Before matching, the distribution 
of these variables differs heavily on two groups. After matching, these
pre-treatment covariates seems to be unified, which helps us to mimic the
situations of Randomized clinical trials(RCT).

            ) %>%
  replace_na(list(Method = "-",
                  Variances = "-",
                  tValue = "-",
                  DF = "-",
                  Probt = "-")
             )
cap_tab1 = paste(
  "**Table 5.** *Perform t test to show significance using two method.*",
  "Diabetes indeed has an effect on heart attack."
)
tab1 %>%
  knitr::kable(format = 'html', caption = cap_tab1) %>%
  kableExtra::kable_styling("striped", full_width = TRUE)
```

#### Explanation

Finally, I provides two tables here. The first one is the mean-std pairs of 
all covariates which shows the difference of two groups. The second one shows 
the t test result, which indicates that after matching, the heart attack rate 
in diabetes patients is still higher than the non-diabetes patients.     
So now we can answer the question at the beginning: Adult patients with 
diabetes do have higher risk for heart attack (myocardial infarction) in the 
United States.

f7 = sprintf('%s/propscoreBias.png', path)
```

```{stata s1, collectcode=TRUE}
import delimited "./data/nhanes.csv", encoding(ISO-8859-1)
```
#### Pre-Processing
##### Packages 
In this tutorial we are using:
* `pscore` package - used to calculate the pscore
* `psmatch2` package - used to match the propensity scores 
* `st0149` package - used to create weights the propensity scores
* `pbalchk` package - used to analyze the weighted propensity scores
*  also using the `teffects` function which is included in STATA

##### Covariate Selection
To accurately balance the covariates, we must look at a few factors
* The covariates should be correlated to both the treatment and 
outcome variables
* If some covariates do not have a statistically significant correlation 
to the outcome variable, we can choose ones that are correlated to the
treatment variable
  + the covariates only correlated to the outcome variable will not have a
  large effect on the covariate balance, so we don't need to include them 
  in our program
  + we should also select covariates that are precursors to our treatment 
  
```{stata s2, collectcode=TRUE}
pwcorr heart_attack diabete relative_heart_attack gender age race edu annual_income bmi smoke_life phy_vigorous phy_moderate blood_press blood_press2 hyper_med hbq_med high_chol meadial_access cover_hc health_diet year_smoke year_hyper, sig star(.05)
```
 
From this correlation table we can see that relative_heart_attack, gender,
age, edu, annual income, bmi, smoke_life, phy_vigorous, phy_moderate,
blood_press, blood_press2, high_chol, meadial_access, cover_hc, health_diet,
year_smoke, and year_hyper, all have statistically significant correlations
with either the treatment variable or both the treatment and outcome variable.
 
Even though the two medications  (`hyper_med`, `hbq_med`) are significant, 
I have not included them because they are used to treat the symptoms 
of diabetes.

##### Initial Data Balance:

We can create a logistic regression model in order to predict the assignment
condition -- Has Diabetes == 1 and Does not have Diabetes == 0. We can also
run a t-test to determine if the treatment has a statistical difference when
compared to the control on our outcome.

```{stata s3, collectcode=TRUE}
logit heart_attack relative_heart_attack gender age edu annual_income bmi diabete smoke_life phy_vigorous phy_moderate blood_press blood_press2 high_chol meadial_access cover_hc health_diet year_smoke year_hyper
 
ttest diabete, by(heart_attack)
```

#### I. Propensity score estimation:
First we must calculate our propensity score, which balances measured
confounders. To do this we are using the pscore package. 

```{stata s4, collectcode=TRUE, results="hide"}
pscore diabete relative_heart_attack gender age edu annual_income bmi smoke_life phy_vigorous phy_moderate blood_press blood_press2 high_chol meadial_access cover_hc health_diet year_smoke year_hyper, pscore(pc_pscore) blockid(pc_block) detail
```
Adding the function detail will allow us to make sure that the covariates 
are balanced across both the treatment and control groups.

We can then graph our unmatched/unweighted covariates, which will show
us the distribution across the two groups.

```{r f4, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(f4)
```


#### II. Propensity score matching/weighting:
There are many types of matching and weighting strategies that we could use. 
In this tutorial I will focus on nearest neighbor matching, kernel matching,
and Inverse-Probability weighting.

##### Matching 
This graph shows the propensity score on the treated variable before matching. 
```{r f5, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(f5)
```

To match the sample by the propensity score we will be using the 
`psmatch2` package for both nearest neighbor and kernel matching.

###### Nearest Neighbor Matching
* Nearest neighbor matching chooses the best control match for each 
individual point in the sample.
* The downside to this matching is that it needs a very large non-treatment 
group to perform better, and because our non-treatment group is not that 
large, this is not the most ideal method.
```{stata s5, collectcode=TRUE}
#match by nearest neighbors
psmatch2 diabete, outcome(heart_attack) pscore(pc_pscore) neighbor(1) caliper(.001) common
```
###### Balance Checking for Nearest Neighbor
We can create a density graph to compare to figure 1a. to see if the 
covariates across both groups are balanced after matching.
```{r f6, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(f6)
```


###### Kernel Matching 
This combines both weighting and matching, where a larger weight is given to 
the controls that are more similar to the treated.
```{stata s6, collectcode=TRUE}
psmatch2 diabete, kernel outcome(heart_attack) pscore(pc_pscore)
```

###### Balance Checking for Kernel Matching
Instead of using a graph to analyze this matching strategy, we can run pstest 
right after we match our scores. 
The ptest will give us standardized differences between the means of the 
matched and unmatched, and also give us insight into the bias reduction, 
which we can see in the graph.
```{r f7, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(f7)
```
This graph shows the percent bias change after matching.

##### Inverse Propensity Score Weighting 
In inverse weighting each treated individual is given a weight of 
$1/pscore$, and each control individual is given a weight of $1/(1-pscore)$
The weights are then normalized to one and we can get an average 
treatment effect for the sample.
```{stata s7, collectcode=TRUE}
#inverse weighting 
qui dr heart_attack diabete relative_heart_attack gender age edu annual_income bmi smoke_life phy_vigorous phy_moderate blood_press blood_press2 high_chol meadial_access cover_hc health_diet year_smoke year_hyper, genvars
#normalize weights
egen sumofweights = total(iptwt)
gen norm_weights = iptwt/sumofweights
```
Next we can create a balance table for the weighted propensity scores 
using the `pbalchk` package. The standardized difference gives us an 
estimate into how much our bias is changed. 
```{stata s8, collectcode=TRUE}
pbalchk diabete relative_heart_attack gender age edu annual_income bmi smoke_life phy_vigorous phy_moderate blood_press blood_press2 high_chol meadial_access cover_hc health_diet year_smoke year_hyper, wt(norm_weights)
```

###### Balance Checking
We can then create a graph to see the matching before and after of the 
covariates, I chose age because in our correlation test it had the strongest 
correlation, and in the balance table it had the greatest positive 
standardized difference. 
```{r f1, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(f1)
```
We can see the density functions show that there is balance across 
both groups.

#### III. Treatment Effects:
The treatment effect models allow us to see "causal effects" for 
observational data.
The treatment effects reweight the data to model an experimental design 
to get randomized results, which hopefully lead to covariate balance
  
#### Treatment Effects on Matched Data
```{stata s9, collectcode=TRUE}
#propensity score matching
teffects psmatch (heart_attack) (diabete smoke_life phy_vigorous phy_moderate blood_press blood_press2 high_chol meadial_access cover_hc health_diet year_smoke year_hyper relative_heart_attack gender age edu annual_income bmi), atet
#summary
tebalance summarize
```
The summary table for `teffects psmatch` will show the he average treatment 
effect from the propensity score matching estimator as the mean of the 
differences between the observed and potential results. We can visualize this 
with a boxplot.
```{r f2, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(f2)
```
The summary table will report the difference between the means and the ratio 
of variances for each covariate. If the covariates are balanced, then the 
ratio of variances should be approximately equal to one. 
#### Inverse Weighting Balance

```{stata s10, collectcode=TRUE}
#inverse weighting 
teffects ipw (heart_attack) (diabete smoke_life phy_vigorous phy_moderate blood_press blood_press2 high_chol meadial_access cover_hc health_diet year_smoke year_hyper relative_heart_attack gender age edu annual_income bmi), atet
#summary
tebalance summary 
```

The summary table will report the difference between the means and the ratio 
of variances for each covariate. If the covariates are balanced, then the 
ratio of variances should be approximately equal to one. We can also create a 
density plot to determine the balance of the weighted sample, and again the 
covariate I am using is age.
```{r f3, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(f3)
```


















## Discussion
Propensity score matching/weighting can eliminate a greater portion of bias 
and facilitate a more precise estimating on treatment effect. Matching by the 
propensity score creates a balanced 1-1 dataset, allowing a clear and direct 
comparison of pre-treatment covariates between groups, and estimates the 
average treatment effect for the treated (ATT). Whereas inverse weighting 
estimates the average treatment effect (ATE), which introduces a scenario that
every patient within the population was offered the treatment (only differs in
extent).

After using propensity score analysis, what you should always remember is to 
check that covariates, especially those key factors, like age or year of hyper
in this case study, are balanced by the propensity score. Without balance, the
underlying theory fails. However, it may not be reasonable to expect perfect 
balance on every one, because even though in an RCT, a comparison of 
covariates will occasionally find differences between groups. 

### Comparison across software
We use 4 different programming languages to go through this tutorial.
When it comes to data visualization, R and Python has a huge advantage 
over Stata and SAS. This is probably because R and Python are open-source, 
then many excellent programmers can contribute their talent, and this is 
why R and Python has more useful and powerful packages or modules than 
the other.

Also, R and Python are very convenient when you output the results. This is 
extremely obvious if you compare them to SAS and Stata. In SAS and Stata, we 
have to write macros to help export the files we want. Even after export, 
things are still troublesome. If you take a look at the output folder under 
the SAS folder in this repo, you will see that the `pre_summary.csv` is very 
thorny to handle in contrasts with the outcome produced by R or Python. 
And in STATA code, some of the command cannot be separated into multiple 
lines, especially in the varlist. Hence, some of the STATA code does not 
satisfy the 79-character limit.

However, at the cost of flexibility, the structure of SAS and Stats provide 
their own advantages. As SAS is more of a procedural language in comparison 
to R, its syntax is easy to understand and learn, also easily debuggable.
